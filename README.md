This project is to enable communities to install Contact Tracing. The aim is to allow collection
of people who participates in a social gathering like resturants and sports events.

The aim of the system is to:
i)  Assure the end users to securely and safley download an app, knowing that thier data is fully protected and only used for Contact Tracing Purpose.
ii)  Allow collection of users contact # (phone # and|or email) while respecting privacy
iii) Allow the event holders an easy way to collect the info. for contact tracing, without disrupting thier business
iv) Allow contact tracers to initiate contact tracing in a fully automated way.
v) Contact tracers themself will not have access to the data.

There are 3 major components
a) Backend APIs to register users, event hosts and actually logging of an event trigged by
the user checking into a place (say for eg. a resturant)
b) Mobile APP to register the user and the event hosts
c) A backend system to validate the authority to inititate the contact tracing.
