Contact Tracing 
Summary:
 COVID has crippled economies world over. Contact Tracing is a key tool and this project is aimed at providing a way for 
 governments and private business to implement contact tracing.
 
 What is Contact Tracing?
A person might have COVID and he may be asymptomatic , in the meanwhile he might be spreading the disease without his/her knowledge. 

How can the asymptomatic person spread ?
He/She might have gone to grocery/ restaurant (even with social distancing)  to shop and virus might spread on the surfaces .
The surfaces are then agents for the virus to spread around and infect more people.

Once a person is identified as COVID positive, a system is needed to go back in time (may be 2 weeks from the positive identification ) and identify all the common places which he visited.

Identifing and contacing people who might have been exposed is a critical part of controlling the spread.
The potential person needs to be isolated and tested. Further this person needs to quarantine as well.
