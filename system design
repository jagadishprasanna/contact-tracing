The goal of contact tracing is to enable governments and business track customers. 
For the customers it is a way to get informed if there were in contact with a COVID infected person.

Customers need not give their phone numbers, we can use in-app messaging to send notification.
It is recommended but not needed.

Requirements:

	A) The system must be scalable to millions of users
	B) System must be reliable and 
	C) System must be able to filter visitors to a shops visited.
	
	Assumptions : All the users and retail shops/restaurants  are expected to have a Mobile device.
	
Contact Tracing is a streaming application -  key core scenarios are

	i) User Registration - All the users registered will be stored in Kafka.
			             Unique GUID will be assigned to the user/app.
				  A QR code will be generated for the user to scan.

    ii)  Shops Registration -
                The shops are required to give their business name and location , a unique shopid will be assgined.


   iii) User/Shop visit -
           The users scan the QR Code at the entrance - (A UserCheckIN event is generated)
           When the user checkout of shop he scans again (A UserCheckOut even is generated)

 iv) User Covid +ve -
     The hospital identifies COVID user, they trigger a CONTACT NOTIFCATION -

      This triggers a search for all the Shops the user visited in the last  2 week and extract the time visited by the Patient..
      For each of these visited places the system further maps all the users that visited the place in the time window..

    For each of this shoppers, the system then sends a notification via in-app or via text that they need to further check and quarantine if need be.



For all of these scenarios we can use Kafka as our backend.
